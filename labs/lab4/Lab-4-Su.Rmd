1. Developing Plan for Wrangling
    * Variables:
        + name, sex, count, year
    * Case: Number of a specific baby name given during a specific year

2. Sketch out the idea
    * x = year
    * y = count renamed as popularity
    * group by name

3. Glyph Ready Data Table
    * Glyph-Ready Data Fram contains name, count as popularity, and year ordered by year
        + sex does not appear at all in the graph
        + Popularity is similar to count, but is renamed
        
4. Cases in Glyph-ready vs. raw input
    * Cases Abraham, Franklin, and Woodrow have been filtered out as the focus for the plot
    * Cases have not been grouped or summarized in any way
    * Yes, there is a new variable popularity, but we don't know the transformation ratio, so we use count instead.

5. Sequence of steps that will accomplish wrangling
    *
6. Translate design into R
```{r}
MyBabyNames <- BabyNames %>%
    select(name, count, year) %>%
    group_by(name, year) %>%
    summarise(popularity = sum(count)) %>%
    filter(name %in% c("Abraham", "Franklin", "Woodrow"))
MyBabyNames %>% head()
```

7. Use ggplot to graph the data
```{r fig.width=6, fig.height = 4}
MyBabyNames %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=popularity, group = name)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, alpha = .5, aes(color = name)) + ylab("Popularity") + xlab("Year")
```
