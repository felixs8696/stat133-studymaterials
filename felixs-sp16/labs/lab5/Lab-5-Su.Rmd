1. Is the data table glyph ready? If not, do I need to need to convert table formats (i.e. narrow to wide) or join another table?
    + The data table is glyph ready, but only certain columns need to be selected.

2. What are the glyphs?
    + The glyphs are black, filled dots

3. What are the aesthetics?
    + x position - Carat
    + y position - Price
    + cut - Color

4. What are the scales (i.e. mappings)
    + x scale - Carat
    + y scale - Price

5. Are there fixed attributes (i.e. col = “red”)?
    + No

6. Are there labels and themes?
    + Yes there are labels, Carat and Price are labeled.
    + Yes there are themes, The title is Blue, the Axes are red
    
Plot:
```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
MyDiamonds <- d %>% select(carat, price, cut)
ggplot(MyDiamonds, aes(x =  carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = cut)) +
  facet_wrap(~ cut) + 
  labs(title = "Diamonds", x = "Carat", y = "Price") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 30, colour = "blue"),  
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, colour = "red"),  
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20, colour = "red")) 
```
