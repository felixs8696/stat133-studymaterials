###1. The following loop can be done as a vectorized calculation. What is the equivalent vectorized calculation?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
vec = 1:50
i = 1

while(i < 50) {
  vec[i] <- i^2
  i <- i + 1
}
```
####Answer:
```{r}
vec = 1:50
i = 1
vec <- sapply(vec, function(i) i^2)
vec
```

###2. Write down what the vector x will contain after each line of R code, if they are executed sequentially.
####  a. x = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- seq(from = 0, to = 8, by = 2) #creates a sequence of even numbers from 0 to 8 inclusive
```
####  b. x = [NA, NA, 4, 6, 8]
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x[x < 4] <- NA #replaces all elements of x that are < 4 with NA
```
####  c. x = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x[] <- 0 #replaces all elements of x with 0s
```
####  d. x = 0
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- 0 #replaces x with 0
```

###3. Fill in the appropriate types of R objects in this sentence: The lapply function in R operates on *a vector or list* and returns *a list*. There may be more than one correct answer.

###4. Suppose we have a 5000 by 3 matrix `m`
```{r}
set.seed(1337)
m <- matrix(runif(15000, -3, 3), ncol = 3)
```

####a. We need to create a vector containing the sum of the squared entries in each row of `m`. Write R code to do this in two different ways:

####* Using a for loop and saving the result in an object called `m.ssq.loop`:
```{r}
m.ssq.loop <- c()
row_sum <- 0
for(r in 1:nrow(m)) {
  for(c in 1:ncol(m)) {
    row_sum <- row_sum + m[r,c]^2
  }
  m.ssq.loop <- c(m.ssq.loop, row_sum)
  row_sum <- 0
}

head(m.ssq.loop) # First few elements
```

####* Using the `apply` function and saving the result in an object called m.ssq.apply (See ?apply):
```{r}
m.ssq.apply <- m %>%
  apply(1:2, function(x) x^2) %>%
  apply(1,sum)

head(m.ssq.apply) # First few elements
```

####b. Write a script that will check if your answers in part (a) are the same. It should return `TRUE` if the two vectors are exactly the same and `FALSE` otherwise. This is called a sanity check, and you should do them often when coding.
```{r}
check_same <- function(x,y) {
  return(isTRUE(all.equal(x,y)))
}

check_same(m.ssq.loop,m.ssq.apply)
```
    
###5. `table1` is given below:
```{r}
Year <- c(2000, 2001)
Algeria <- c(7 ,9)
Brazil <- c(12, NA)
Columbia <- c(16, 18)

table1 <- data.frame(Year, Algeria, Brazil, Columbia)
table1
```

####a. Wrangle `table1` into the object `table2` as shown below:
```{r}
table2 <- table1 %>%
  gather(key="Country", val="Value", Algeria, Brazil, Columbia)
table2
```

####b. Use `table2` to produce `table3` as printed below:
```{r}
grouped <- table2 %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(Average = mean(Value, na.rm=TRUE))
table3 <- table2 %>%
    spread(key="Country", val="Value") %>%
    transform(Average = grouped$Average)
# ------------------------OR-------------------------
# wide <- table2 %>%
#   wide(key="Country", val="Value")
# table3 <- spread %>%
#   transform(Average = rowMeans(wide[,-1], na.rm = TRUE))
table3
```

###6. Consider the following graphic:
####a. What are the glyphs in this graph?
        Answer: The glyphs are dots representing people in the CPS85 table 
####b. What are the aesthetics of each glyph?
        Answer: x-pos, y-pos, color
####c. Which variables are being mapped to each aesthetic?
        Answer: x-pos: years of education, y-pos: wage ($/hr), color: sex
####d. Are the variables qualitative or quantitative?
        Answer: yrs of education: quantitative, wage: quantitative, sex: qualitative
####e. What are the guides on this graph?
        Answer: x-axis: yrs of education, y-axis: hourly wage, color-legend: sex
####f. Reconstruct this graphic using ggplot and the CPS85 data table. (Hint: the font size of the plot title is 20)
```{r}
CPS85 %>%
  subset(wage <= 15) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=educ,y=wage,col=sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 15, 5)) +
  labs(title = "Wage vs. Education in CPS85") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20))
```

###7. Consider the string my.string given below:
```{r}
my.string <- "ggplot2 is a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R"
```

####a. Write a function `SplitChars` that takes a character string as input and splits it into a vector of single character elements. Hint: the function `strsplit()` may be useful. The result of calling the function on my.string is shown.
```{r}
SplitChars <- function(str) {
  return(unlist(strsplit(str, "")))
}
my.string <- SplitChars(my.string)
my.string
```

####b. Write a for loop that counts the number of times that a, s, R, r appears in `my.string` and saves it in an object called `count`.
```{r}
count <- 0
for(i in 1:length(my.string)) {
  char <- my.string[i]
  if(char == "a" || char == "s" || char == "R" || char == "r") count <- count + 1
}
count
```

####c. Write a function Reverse that reverses the order of a vector of single characters. The result of using it on SplitChars(my.string) is shown below.
```{r}
my.string <- "ggplot2 is a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R"
Reverse <- function(vec) {
  return(vec[length(vec):1])
}
my.string %>% SplitChars %>% Reverse
```
