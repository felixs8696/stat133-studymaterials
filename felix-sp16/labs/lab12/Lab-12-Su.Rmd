##3. Match English Regex
1. 3 Ordinary English Phrases
    * "Get me a b."
    * "Get me a p."
    * "Get me a u."
2. What part of the phrase would be extracted?
    * The middle portion described by `([a-zA-z]+)` will be extracted.

##7. Somelines

**ANS:** Returns the number of unique lines in the file

##8. Newdata.csv
`cat data.csv | grep "California" | cut -d "," -f 3-7 > newdata.csv`

**ANS:** newdata.csv would contain only columns 3 and 7, delimited by commas and only rows that contain the string "California"

##9. Meta Characters

* +: Repeat one or more times
* *: Repeat zero or one time
* ?: Repeat zero or more times

Phrases that match `d?s*[mn]$`:

* dddsn
* adsm
* dm
* ssn
* dsmn
