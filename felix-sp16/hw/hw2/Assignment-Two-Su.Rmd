## Inv Data
**Properties:** 'data.frame':	`r inv_casenum` obs. of  `r inv_varnum` variables  
**Variables:** `r inv_variables`
**Description:** Shows data about each book's status in inventory. This is mostly used for logistical information regarding checkout, shelving, sorting, etc. A user would retrieve from this table if he/she wants information about the state of the library.

## Bks Data
**Properties:** 'data.frame':	`r bks_casenum` obs. of  `r bks_varnum` variables  
**Variables:** `r bks_variables`  
**Description:** Shows data representing each book. This is used to store the book's specific details such as author, title, Dewey decimal number, etc. A user would retrieve from this table if he/she wants information about the state of individual books.

#### Inv Grouped by Status
```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Current.Status) %>%
  tally()
```

#### Inv Grouped by Issue Count
```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Issued.Count) %>%
  tally()
```

**Description:** The first data frame, grouped by `Current.Status`, shows the number of books currently at each status ('AVAILABLE', 'MISSING', 'ON_LOAN', 'WITHDRAWN') and the second data frame, grouped by `Issued.Count`, shows the number of times each book was checked out.
