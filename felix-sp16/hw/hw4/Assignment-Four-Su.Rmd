##Births Each Day

1. New table DailyBirths
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
DailyBirths <- Birthdays %>%
  group_by(date, wday) %>%
  tally(births) %>%
  rename(total = n)
ggplot(DailyBirths, aes(x = date, y = total)) + geom_point(size = .5) + ggtitle("DailyBirths")
```

2. Seasonality of Birth Rates
    1) Number of births **each week**
    2) Number of births **each month**
    3) Number of births each **Julian Day**
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
ggplot(DailyBirths, aes(x = week(date), y = total)) + geom_point(size = .5) + ggtitle("Number of Births Each Week")
```
    
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
ggplot(DailyBirths, aes(x = month(date), y = total)) + geom_point(size = .5) + ggtitle("Number of Births Each Month")
```
    
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
ggplot(DailyBirths, aes(x = yday(date), y = total)) + geom_point(size = .5) + ggtitle("Number of Births Each Julian Day") 
```

3. Number of births by **day of the week**
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
ggplot(DailyBirths, aes(x = wday, y = total)) + geom_point(size = .5) + ggtitle("Number of Births by Weekday")
```

4. MyTwoYears Data Table and Plot
    + A clear pattern appears that shows most people born in the years 1980-1981 were born closer to the middle of the week.
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
MyTwoYears <- DailyBirths %>%
    filter(year(date) >= 1980, year(date) <= 1981)
ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(x = date, y = total, color=wday)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Births during 1980 and 1981 (MyTwoYears)")
```

##Births and Holidays

5. Read in US Holidays Data
```{r}
Holidays <- read.csv("http://tiny.cc/dcf/US-Holidays.csv") %>% mutate(date = lubridate::dmy(date))
```
6. Add Holiday layers to plot 4
    1. Add vertical bars to each holiday to the plot from 4
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(x = date, y = total)) + geom_point(aes(color=wday)) + geom_vline(data = Holidays, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(date), color = as.factor(wday(date, label=TRUE)))) + ggtitle("MyTwoYears with Holidays Marked by VLines")
```
    
    2. Add Holiday text labels
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
myHolidays <- Holidays %>% filter(year(date) >= 1980, year(date) <= 1981)
ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(x = date, y = total)) + geom_point(aes(color=wday)) + geom_vline(data = Holidays, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(date), color = as.factor(wday(date, label=TRUE)))) + geom_text(data = myHolidays, aes(x = date, y = 9000, label = holiday, angle = 80)) + ggtitle("MyTwoYears with Holidays Labeled")
```

7. Join MyTwoYears with Holidays
```{r}
MyTwoYears <- MyTwoYears %>%
    select(date, wday, total) %>%
    left_join(Holidays %>% select(date, holiday), by=c("date"="date"))
head(MyTwoYears)
```

8. Mutate MyTwoYears holidays to Yes or No
```{r}
MyTwoYears <- MyTwoYears %>%
    mutate(is_holiday = ifelse(is.na(holiday), "no", "yes"))
head(MyTwoYears)
```

9. Set MyTwoYears glyph size to correspond to is_holiday. Check hypothesis.
    + Yes, the hypothesis from (5) holds because the plot shows that weekdays that fall on holidays tend to have less births than weekdays that are not during holidays
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(x = date, y = total, color=wday, size = is_holiday)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("MyTwoYears with Holidays Marked by Size")
```
