Problem 1.1
(a) Taffy = categorical
(b) year = quantitative
(c) sex = categorical
(d) name = Value of a variable for a particular case
(e) count = quantitative

Problem 1.2

Not Tidy because variables do not each have the same sort of value recorded for each row
“Lincoln, Abraham" should be “Abraham Lincoln”
“1837 to 1941” should be “1837-1841” (actually probably better to have start and end columns)
“it depends” should split the case into multiple rows with concrete values for state number
Problem 1.3

President	Start_Term	End_Term	State_Number
Abraham Lincoln	1861	1862	32
Abraham Lincoln	1862	1864	22
Abraham Lincoln	1864	1865	23
Abraham Lincoln	1865	1865	24
George Washington	1791	1799	16
Martin Van Buren	1837	1841	26
Note: answers may vary for Lincoln because states entered and seceded from the union during the Civil War, and opinion differ on secession
These numbers exclude seceded states

(Might also be good idea to split the First and Last names for data processing reasons)

Problem 1.4

Table A Variables: Year, Algeria, Brazil, Columbia
Table B Variables: Country, Y2000, Y2001
Table C Variables: Country, Year, Value
Table A Case: A year
Table B Case: A country
Table C Case: A country in a year

Problem 2.6

essay14 = Legit
first-essay = Legit
"MyData" = Not Legit - Quotations denote String, not Object
third_essay = Legit
small sample = Not Legit - can’t have spaces in Object names
functionList = Legit
FuNcTiOnLiSt = Legit
.MyData. = Legit
sqrt() = Not Legit - indicates a command
